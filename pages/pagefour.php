            <h1>Why Not Blame Curley's Wife?</h1>
            <p>

                Curley's wife is not to blame for 
                the events due to the fact that she 
                had no idea that Lennie was strong 
                enough to accidentally snap her neck.
                She just wanted to make friends and 
                not be lonely which caused her to talk
                to Lennie since he was the only one 
                willing to talk to her.
